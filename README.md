# 🎯 Project Objective

**An AI-Powered Skill Journey Tracker and Adaptive Learning App**

**LevelUp** is a full-stack web application where users can create learning journeys to master new skills. The app uses **Google Gemini AI** to generate personalized challenges (quests) that evolve based on the user's progress and feedback.  

This project is built using **Node + Express**, **MongoDB**, and **React (Hooks)**. The backend manages CRUD operations for users and learning journeys, while the frontend dynamically renders progress using client-side rendering.

## 🛠️ Instructions to Build / Run

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or later)
- **MongoDB Atlas** or local Mongo instance
- **Git** (for cloning)
- **Render** (for deployment)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamtheretronerd/Web-dev-Project-3.git
   cd Web-dev-Project-3
   ```

2. **Backend setup**

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run start
   or
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Frontend setup**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Environment variables**

   Create `.env` files in both backend and frontend folders.

   **Backend (.env)**  
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=<your MongoDB URI>
   PORT=3001
   GEMINI_API_KEY=<gemini api key>
   ```

   **Frontend (.env)**  
   ```env
   VITE_API_URL=https://web-dev-project-3.onrender.com
   ```

5. **Access the app**
   - Local Development: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)  
   - Deployment: [https://web-dev-project-3.onrender.com/dashboard](https://web-dev-project-3.onrender.com/dashboard)

| – Project description | ⚙️ Pending | To be detailed in design document. |
| – User Personas | ⚙️ Pending | Will include 2–3 realistic personas (e.g., student, hobbyist). |
| – User stories | ⚙️ Pending | Example: “As a learner, I can create a skill journey to improve at chess.” |
| – Design mockups | ⚙️ Pending | Screenshots and Figma wireframes will be added. |
| **Does the app accomplish all approved requirements?** | ✅ | [Live App on Render](https://web-dev-project-3.onrender.com/dashboard) fully functional with CRUD and AI level generation. |
| **Is the app usable / includes instructions?** | ✅ | Detailed instructions provided in this README. |
| **Is the app actually useful?** | ✅ | Encourages users to gamify their learning progress with AI feedback. |
| **ESLint config (no errors)** | ✅ | [eslint.config.js](./eslint.config.js) passes cleanly. |
| **Code properly organized (components, DB, CSS folders)** | ✅ | Clear structure:<br>• `/backend/routes` — REST APIs<br>• `/backend/db/myMongoDB.js` — Mongo wrapper<br>• `/frontend/src/components` — React components<br>• `/frontend/src/styles` — CSS Modules |
| **Implements ≥ 3 React Components (using hooks)** | ✅ | Uses 7 components built with hooks:<br>• `Login.jsx`, `Signup.jsx`, `Dashboard.jsx`, `Profile.jsx`, `Game.jsx`, `Navigation.jsx`, `CreateJourney.jsx`.<br>Each uses `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useNavigate` for state & routing. |
| **Each React Component saved in its own file** | ✅ | [frontend/src/components/](./frontend/src/components) — Each component has a separate `.jsx` file. |

## 🧠 GenAI Usage

This project used **GenAI tools** (ChatGPT / GPT-5) for:

- Brainstorming, code reviews, and documentation refinement.
- Validating accessibility, semantic HTML, and ESLint/Prettier consistency.

**Prompts Used:**

> “Review my code file for semantic structure, accessibility issues, and best practices.”

**The below prompt is used in the API to generate AI-based idea**

> "Generate ONE specific, actionable task that:
    1. Can be completed in ${timeCommitment}
    2. Is appropriate for a ${level} level learner
    3. Builds on previous tasks (if any)
    4. Is concrete and measurable (the user should know when they've completed it)

    Respond with ONLY the task description in 1-2 sentences. Be specific and actionable. Do not include level numbers, greetings, or explanations.

    Examples of good tasks:
    - "Cook scrambled eggs with three ingredients and serve with toast"
    - "Practice speaking for 60 seconds about your day without using filler words"
    - "Build a simple paper airplane that can fly at least 10 feet"

**Validation:**  
All outputs were manually reviewed, iterated, and integrated **only after confirming**:

- Compliance with semantic **HTML5** and **accessibility** standards
- ESLint / Prettier formatting rules
- Academic integrity and rubric compliance

notes
run eslint . separately in frontend folder and root
this is because the eslint.config.js is different for both
ignore if lint error comes in root for the /frontend folder and run separately in frontend folder.
